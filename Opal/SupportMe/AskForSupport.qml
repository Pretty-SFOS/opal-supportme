    \brief Regularily invite users to support the project.

    It is difficult to engage users to actually contribute
    to open source projects. With this component, you can
    regularily remind users of the different ways to support
    you (the developer) or the project through contributions.

    The module provides a simple API to define your own content.
    You can get started quickly by copying the example below,
    or by copying from other apps that use this module.

    Example:

    \qml
    // file: harbour-myapp.qml
    ApplicationWindow {
        id: app
        initialPage: Qt.resolvedUrl("pages/FirstPage.qml")

        AskForSupport {
            contents: Component {
                MySupportDialog {}
            }
        }
    }

    // file: MySupportDialog.qml
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import Sailfish.Silica 1.0
    import Opal.SupportMe 1.0

    SupportDialog {
        SupportAction {
            icon: SupportIcon.Liberapay
            title: qsTr("Donate on Liberapay")
            description: qsTr("Pay the amount of a cup of coffee, a slice " +
                              "of pizza, or a ticket to the theater.")
            link: "https://liberapay.com/ichthyosaurus"
        }

        SupportAction {
            icon: SupportIcon.Weblate
            title: qsTr("Translate on Weblate")
            description: qsTr("Help with translating this app in as many " +
                              "languages as possible.")
            link: "https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/opal"
        }

                           "single developer in their spare time, and is provided " +
                           "to you free of charge.")
            }

            DetailsParagraph {
                text: qsTr("I develop Free Software because I am convinced that " +
                           "it is the ethical thing to do - and it is a fun hobby. " +
                           "However, developing software takes a lot of time and effort. " +
                           "As Sailfish and living in general costs money, I need your " +
                           "support to be able to spend time on non-paying projects " +
                           "like this.")
            }
        }

        DetailsDrawer {
            title: qsTr("Why donate?")

            DetailsParagraph {
                text: qsTr("Jolla raised prices and is trying to force " +
                           "developers (who work for free) to pay rent for Sailfish.")
            }

            DetailsParagraph {
                text: qsTr("If you can afford it, donating is the easiest way " +
                           "to ensure that I can continue working on apps " +
                           "for Sailfish. Any amount is appreciated, be it a cup " +
                           "of coffee, a slice of pizza, or more.")
            }
        }
    }
    \endqml

    The module is built with performance in mind. Any impact on
    app startup times should be minimal.
